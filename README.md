# Sales_Dashboard_2023
Project Overview:
This project analyzes historical retail sales data, identifies trends and patterns, and builds a forecasting model to predict future sales. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model using time series analysis.

### Objectives:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve model performance.
Model Building: Develop a time series forecasting model to predict future sales.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Conclusion: Summarize findings and provide actionable insights.

Tool and Technology: SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, Handling missing values, Converting data types, Feature extraction and transformation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize sales trends over time, Analyzing seasonality and cyclic patterns, Identifying outliers and anomalies.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features based on date (e.g., day of the week, month, year) and Aggregate sales data by various dimensions (e.g., store, item).
4. Model Building: Split the data into training and test sets and Choose appropriate time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
5. Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the models.
